# Data Collection:
We will utilize data that simulates the web traffic behaviours of a websites such as www.jambojet.com taking into account their marketing campaigns, travel restrictions and other industry factors that may affect web traffic.

To do such a project you can use scraping techniques to extract real-time time series data from Google Analytics, ensuring accuracy and relevance for forecasting models within the context of total and new users per day.

## Dataset Overview: 
This dataset captures daily fluctuations in user engagement, essential for precise forecasting and ad optimization. 

## Data Features
The dataset includes variables such as **total users**, **new users**, **time stamps**, and **travel-related indicators**. 
These features enable a granular analysis of daily user patterns, essential for understanding travel-specific behaviours.

# Success Criteria: Metric for Success: 
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) This metric serves as a robust measure to evaluate the accuracy of our time series forecasting models, specifically focusing on predicting daily total users and new users. The significance of achieving a low RMSE lies in its ability to reflect the precision of our forecasting models.

Achieving a low RMSE aligns with the broader goal of contributing to the sustainable development of Jambojet's online advertising ecosystem. By providing precise forecasts, the project facilitates strategic decision-making, ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated to enhance the user experience and sustain a thriving advertising platform.
