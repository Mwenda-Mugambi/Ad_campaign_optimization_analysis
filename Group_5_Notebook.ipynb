This substantial difference strongly indicates the potential presence of outliers, particularly on the higher end of the distribution. Data points beyond the upper whisker of the boxplot for 'Simulated_Users' may be considered outliers, pointing to unusually high daily user counts.\n",

    "Similarly, 'Simulated_New_Users' presents a maximum value of 117,086, which significantly surpasses the third quartile (Q3) of 9,550.75. This divergence between the maximum value and Q3 strongly suggests potential outliers on the higher end for new user counts. Data points beyond the upper whisker of the boxplot for 'Simulated_New_Users' may be indicative of unusually high daily values for new user acquisition.\n",

    "Identification of these outliers, particularly on the higher end, raises concerns about the potential skewing of the distribution and subsequent impacts on our overall analysis. Furter investigation into the nature of these outliers and implementation of outlier-handling techniques is therefore crucial in ensuring the accuracy of our time series forecasts."

    "- In March 2020, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya prompted significant measures to curb the spread of the virus. On 15th March 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta, along with Cabinet Secretary for Health Mutahi Kagwe, announced a series of restrictions. [Travel from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases was restricted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/15/kenya-blocks-entry-for-non-residents-in-virus-response), only allowing entry to Kenyan citizens and foreigners with valid residence permits subject to self-quarantine or government-designated facilities. Schools and higher learning institutions were closed, remote work was encouraged, and essential services continued. Cashless transactions were promoted, and various gatherings were restricted, including weddings, malls, nightclubs, churches, and hospital visits. Cargo vessels, aircraft, or ships were permitted, subject to disinfection and crew quarantine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By late March 2020, confirmed cases in Kenya increased, leading to the ban of all social gatherings, including religious gatherings. Additionally, a [suspension on international flights imposed](https://www.africanews.com/2020/03/23/kenya-suspends-all-international-flights-as-covid-19-cases-double//) effective from 25th March, causing a dampening effect on tourism. As the month progressed, cases continued to rise, and the first COVID-19-related death was reported on 26th March.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before the announcements on 15th March 2020, Jambojet's website experienced relatively stable user numbers, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating between 9,257 and 15,635, and 'New_Simulated_Users' ranging from 5,575 to 9,776. However, as the COVID-19 measures took effect post-announcement, there was a notable decline in website visitors. 'Simulated_Users' dropped from 11,961 on 16th March 2020 to a low of 2,995 towards the end of the month. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' decreased from a high of 6,538 following the March 15th announcement to lows of 1,516 towards the end of the month.\n",

However, following the announcement of movement restrictions on the 8th of April 2020, the number of users continued to fluctuate, but there was a notable decline in 'Simulated_Users' on Jambojet's website. The figures plummeted from 1,271 to a minimum of 561 users per day in the latter part of the month. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' experienced a decrease from 812 to a low of 322 users per day.\n",

Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' ranged from highs of 723 to lows of 248, also representing the lowest daily user count observed in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- June continued to experience low traffic to Jambojet's website, consistently remaining below 1,000 daily users. However, there were brief periods of improvement, particularly as Kenyans anticipated the potential lifting of curfews and travel restrictions. Between the 3rd and 9th of June 2020, there was a minimal spike in traffic, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating from 2,232 to 1,198 and 'New_Simulated_Users' ranging from 2,053 to 896. A similar pattern occurred on the 29th and 30th of June, where 'Simulated_Users' reached 1,193 and 1,135 users, and 'New_Simulated_Users' hit 1,085 and 934 users, respectively.\n",

The cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa County, and Mandera County was lifted, providing significant relief for the affected regions. Additionally, local air travel was scheduled to resume from July 15 under the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health and Transport. In line with this, [Jambojet announced the resumption of its operations to 5 local destinations](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/covid-19-updates/jambojet-to-resume-operations-to-local-destinations/).

This easing of restrictions, particularly the resumption of air travel, presented a positive outlook for Jambojet as web traffic began to steadily increase to expected levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Following the announcement on July 6, there was a remarkable upswing in traffic to Jambojet's website. 'Simulated_Users' increased substantially, rising from a range of 656 to 996 users between July 1st and 5th, 2020, to an impressive 5,050 users on July 6th, 2020. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' witnessed a significant improvement, elevating from a range of 496 to 888 users from July 1st to 5th, 2020, to 4,514 users on July 6th, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The positive trend in user traffic continued, with another notable spike following the announcement on July 15th 2020 regarding the resumption of local air travel. Consequently, 'Simulated_Users' surged to 14,518, and 'New_Simulated_Users' reached 14,382. In the subsequent days and months, web traffic demonstrated sustained improvement, with no dips below 3,500 daily users and achieving a highs of up to 22,598 'Simulated_Users' and 17,105 'New_Simulated_Users'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The impact of COVID-19 was again felt by the airline on 26th March 2021, following President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive to cease movement between major counties as a measure to curb the spread of the virus, [Jambojet declared the temporary suspension of operations from 29th March 2021 until further notice](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/covid-19-updates/jambojet-operations-update-following-presidential-executive-order-on-covid-19/). This announcement triggered a notable spike in visits to the airline's website, as individuals sought to make travel arrangements before the implementation of the movement restrictions. On 26th March, the site experienced a surge with 37,380 'Simulated_Users' and 26,967 'Simulated_New_Users,' and on 27th March, 27,812 'Simulated_Users' and 16,875 'Simulated_New_Users' visited the site. However, this uptick was followed by a subsequent decline in website visitors, reflecting the broader impact of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed on travel. The suspension of movement was later lifter on 1st May 2021."

    "Over a six-year period, the analysis reveals that Winter consistently attracted the highest web traffic for both 'Simulated_Users' and 'New_Simulated_Users,' peaking at approximately 7 million and 4.5 million users, respectively. Following closely, Autumn exhibited robust engagement with around 6 million 'Simulated_Users' and 4 million 'New_Simulated_Users.' Summer followed suit with an approximate count of 5 million 'Simulated_Users' and 3.5 million 'New_Simulated_Users.' Lastly, Spring recorded about 4.8 million 'Simulated_Users' and 2.9 million 'New_Simulated_Users.'\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns align with the observed trends, indicating that promotions yielding the highest web traffic counts often occur during Autumn and Winter. This correlation also corresponds to broader travel patterns in the country. As the end of the month approaches, people tend to take leave from work, and schools close for the December holidays, boosting travel interest. The Autumn and Winter seasons, associated with increased tourism and travel, witness a surge in visits and bookings on Jambojet's website. Moreover, the Summer holiday, though less popular for international tourists compared to Winter, becomes an opportune time for Kenyans in the diaspora to return home. Additionally, students in British system schools take extended breaks during the Summer months, contributing to heightened travel activity during this season."
